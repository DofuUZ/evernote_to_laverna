# evernote_to_laverna
An Evernote to Laverna Conversion Script


# Intro
This script converts an Evernote enex export into laverna notes.

# Prep
First you must open the Evernote desktop client and select all notes. Then go to file>Export and save the enex file.

# Usage
Run the command python evernote_to_laverna.py (enexfile) and it will export a zip file named laverna.zip. In laverna, go to settings, Import/Export then import data. Wait a second for it to do a little dance, then the page will refresh and you will be free of the shackles of a 1GB memory note taking app.
